# Objects

# Object is like creating your own variable type
a =  1234 # Number
b = [1,2,3,4] # List-General version of sequence in Python
c = (1,2,3,4) # Tuple-Similar to list but they can be changed
d = {'c1':1}  # Dictionary-Mapping in Python 
def sum(add):
	return add

# Checking the type of objects
print type(a)
print type(b)
print type(c)
print type(d)
print type (sum)
